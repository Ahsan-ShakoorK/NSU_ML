# NSU Machine Learning Course

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Course** repository for Novosibirsk State University (NSU). This repository contains all course materials, including lecture notes, code examples, lab exercises, assignments, and project guidelines to help students master core machine learning concepts and applications.

## ðŸ“š Course Overview

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to Machine Learning, covering both theoretical foundations and practical applications. Topics include:

- Supervised Learning: Linear and non-linear models, decision trees, ensemble methods, SVMs, and k-NN
- Unsupervised Learning: Clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection
- Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning
- Feature Engineering and Model Interpretability
- Reinforcement Learning and Model Deployment
- Ethical Considerations in Machine Learning

## ðŸ—‚ Repository Contents

- **Lectures**: Slides and notes for each topic covered in the course.
- **Labs**: Jupyter notebooks and exercises for hands-on practice.
- **Assignments**: Weekly assignments for reinforcing the learned concepts.
- **Projects**: Guidelines and examples for the final project.
- **Resources**: Additional reading materials, research papers, and references.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
