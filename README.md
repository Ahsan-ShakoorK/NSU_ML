# NSU Machine Learning Course

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Course** repository for Novosibirsk State University (NSU). This repository contains all course materials, including lecture notes, code examples, lab exercises, assignments, and project guidelines to help students master core machine learning concepts and applications.

## ðŸ“š Course Overview

This hands-on machine learning course covers essential supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. Students will explore key algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, KNN, SVMs, and ensemble methods, as well as unsupervised approaches like clustering and dimensionality reduction.

The course focuses on practical skills, with coding exercises and assignments to reinforce learning. It culminates in a final project where students will apply their knowledge to solve a real-world problem.

Learning Outcomes:

- Understand and implement key machine learning algorithms.
- Apply techniques to real-world data.
- Complete a final project demonstrating proficiency.

This course is designed for those who want to develop practical machine learning skills.

## ðŸ—‚ Repository Contents

- **Lectures**: Slides and notes for each topic covered in the course.
- **Labs**: Jupyter notebooks and exercises for hands-on practice.
- **Assignments**: Weekly assignments for reinforcing the learned concepts.
- **Projects**: Guidelines and examples for the final project.
- **Resources**: Additional reading materials, research papers, and references.
